# Path-Finding-Algorithm-testing-in-a-Unity-Environment

In this project, we test path finding algorithms in an environment made using the unity 3d engine. The environment features a starting node and an ending node, as well as obstacles. We examine the following algorithms: BFS, DFS, UCS, and A* with different heuristics implemented using C#. We will then go on and compare them based on their respective expanded nodes, fringe, and time. The area of search is a grid made in the unity engine, which give us the advantage of giving us a good visualization for the different pathfinding algorithms.

The time taken for each algorithm was evaluated using the Stopwatch class from System.Diagnostics. The Stopwatch Class Provides a set of methods and properties that can be used to accurately measure elapsed time. We outputted the time in milliseconds.
